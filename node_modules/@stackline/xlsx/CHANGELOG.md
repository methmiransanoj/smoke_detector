# CHANGELOG

This log is intended to keep track of backwards-incompatible changes, including
but not limited to API changes and file location changes.  Minor behavioral
changes may not be included if they are not expected to break existing code.

## v1.0.9

- Organize the README with package links and the Stackline Reddit community.
- Refine npm discovery keywords and publish verified artifacts through GitHub Actions.

## v1.0.8

* Use the maintained Stackline development dependencies directly, remove the
  unused `word` package, and update Mocha to 12.0.2 without legacy overrides.
* Reject repeated CFB sectors, handle unpaired UTF-16 surrogates in embedded
  CRC-32, and preserve literal periods in SSF date formats.
* Preserve UTF-8 encoding results across later codepage calls in both CommonJS
  and ESM. Rebuild the browser bundles with the scoped Uglify fork.
* Keep the public API, TypeScript declarations, and zero runtime dependencies.

* Preserve negative and very small finite values in NUMBERS decimal encoding,
  and correct signed WK3 floating-point reads and writes.
* Preserve array-valued worksheet filters when cloning read options.
* Add a local interactive playground and automated format regressions.
* Fixed Ethercalc escape decoding so encoded backslashes are decoded exactly
  once instead of being reinterpreted as a second escape sequence.
* Replaced ad hoc SYLK regular-expression construction with complete literal
  escaping and removed HTML assignment from the SSF browser demo.
* Added source-focused CodeQL analysis that excludes generated distribution
  bundles and test fixtures while retaining checks for shipped source code.
* Replaced vulnerable `esbuild 0.14.14` pins in auxiliary module, `otorp`, DTA,
  and bundle-metric builds with `0.28.2`.
* Added reproducible lockfiles plus CI build and audit coverage for the nested
  module and `otorp` toolchains. CI tests the regenerated output and release
  builds reproduce the same path. The public `@stackline/xlsx` API is unchanged.
* Reordered existing `types` export conditions ahead of runtime conditions so
  modern resolvers select the declarations without changing any export path.
* Made auxiliary generated-file rewrites portable across GNU and BSD `sed` so
  the new Linux CI build matches local macOS builds.
* Limited the `otorp` release build contract to its two published Node files;
  its optional browser target now declares the attainable ES2015 baseline.

## v1.0.7

* Updated the development-only `js-yaml` dependency from 4.3.1 to 4.3.2 to
  address GHSA-2883-xcg3-v3hh. It is used by the test tooling and is not a
  runtime dependency of the published package.
* Runtime behavior, public APIs and TypeScript declarations are unchanged.

## v1.0.6

* Restored the legacy `any` return declarations for `writeFile`,
  `writeFileXLSX` and `writeFileAsync`. Runtime behavior is unchanged; this
  preserves TypeScript source compatibility for existing `1.x` consumers.
* Added declaration contract checks across TypeScript 3.9 through 7 so future
  patch releases cannot accidentally narrow the legacy return types.
* Replaced ad hoc build-version extraction with structured `package.json`
  parsing and added a contract test that keeps package, CommonJS and ESM
  versions aligned.
* Formalized the release policy: public type declarations are part of the API,
  broad upstream functional merges require a minor release and breaking
  changes require a major release.
* Added automated daily npm download snapshots by package version to make
  adoption decisions from historical data instead of a single weekly view.

## v1.0.5

* Fixed `XLSX.stream.to_json` progression when `skipHidden` encounters hidden
  rows, preventing an infinite loop and preserving the expected visible rows.
* Added the opt-in `sanitizeLinks` HTML export option. It uses a bounded,
  linear parser and permits relative URLs plus common safe protocols while
  leaving default hyperlink behavior unchanged for compatibility.
* Extended type validation through TypeScript 7 while retaining TypeScript 3.9
  coverage and the existing public declaration shape.
* Added Node.js 26 checks without removing Node.js 20 compatibility coverage.
* Refreshed development-only dependency resolutions and CI supply-chain pins.
* Added an Apache-2.0 `NOTICE` file covering SheetJS attribution and Stackline
  downstream maintenance.

## v1.0.4

* Incorporated SheetJS Community Edition `v0.20.3` functional updates:
  NUMBERS / ODS merge parsing fixes, NaN / Infinity handling, XLML streaming
  write support, `Int8Array` input parsing and CSV leading-ID quoting.
* Preserved Stackline security hardening for prototype pollution and ReDoS
  regression coverage while merging the upstream parser and writer changes.
* Prepared this version for Verdaccio validation before any public npm release.

## v1.0.3

* Refreshed development security tooling and removed abandoned audit sources
  from the release workflow.
* Replaced legacy `dtslint` checks with the maintained TypeScript compiler
  check used by the local package flow.
* Migrated ESLint checks to the current flat-config format while preserving the
  existing warning-only behavior for historical generated files.
* Fixed hidden HTML row detection for modern DOM environments when visibility is
  defined through CSS rules.

## v1.0.2

* Fixed public README and docs license links to point to the active GitHub
  branch license file.
* Added an explicit Apache-2.0 license link in the README license section and
  public docs footer.

## v1.0.1

* Modernized the public GitHub Actions release checks for supported Node.js
  versions (`20.x`, `22.x` and `24.x`).
* Kept legacy Node `0.x` and `io.js` checks available as manual workflows
  because scoped public npm packages and current dev tooling no longer support
  those runtimes.
* Stabilized Deno tests by pinning remote standard-library imports and using a
  local base64 helper in the test harness.
* Updated Bun tests to use the maintained Makefile target.
* Stopped push checks from refreshing optional external fixture repositories
  that are no longer reliable; CI now uses the pinned fixture archive.
* Removed the temporary `stackline-secure` branch and kept `github` as the
  only principal branch.

## v1.0.0

* Established the public Stackline package line as `@stackline/xlsx@1.0.0`.
* Made `npm install @stackline/xlsx` the primary documented install path and
  kept `xlsx@npm:@stackline/xlsx` as the migration path for existing imports.
* Centralized unsafe key handling with shared helpers for dangerous keys:
  `__proto__`, `prototype` and `constructor`.
* Hardened parser dictionaries with null-prototype maps in workbook, XML,
  relationship, custom property, ODS, XLS, XLML and ZIP parsing paths.
* Preserved `SheetNames` semantics in ZIP parsing while ignoring dangerous
  worksheet names.
* Preserved JSON header column positions when dangerous headers are ignored.
* Added stronger regression coverage for real XLSX, ODS and XLS workbooks,
  relationship IDs, custom properties, JSON headers and malformed HTML input.
* Added a Verdaccio consumer smoke-test environment with direct and alias usage
  examples.
* Kept `npm run build`, `make dist` and package dry-run validation in the
  release flow.
* Removed the deprecated `xlsx` CLI from the Stackline package manifest to keep
  the published library dependency-free at runtime.

## v0.20.2-stackline.1

* Reworked project documentation in the Stackline package style.
* Added public `SECURITY.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents for npm
  publication.
* Included project documentation files in the package tarball.

## v0.20.2-stackline.0

* Prepared scoped compatibility package `@stackline/xlsx`.
* Added fork-level guards for prototype pollution keys (`__proto__`,
  `prototype`, `constructor`) in worksheet names, XML attributes,
  relationships, custom properties and JSON conversion helpers.
* Added regression tests for GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6 / CVE-2023-30533.
* Retained upstream v0.20.2 ReDoS hardening for GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9 /
  CVE-2024-22363 and added a malformed HTML regression test.
